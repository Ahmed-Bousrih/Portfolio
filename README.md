# Ahmed Bousrih Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website! This project is built with **Vue 3** and showcases my skills, projects, and experience in a modern, responsive design.

## Layout Overview

The website is structured into clear, reusable components for a smooth user experience:

- **Header** – Navigation bar with dark mode toggle and mobile-friendly menu.
- **Hero** – Introduction section with a brief overview.
- **About** – Personal bio and background.
- **Skills** – Technical skills and tools.
- **Projects** – Showcase of my projects with descriptions and links.
- **Experience** – Professional experience and accomplishments.
- **Contact** – Contact form to get in touch.
- **Footer** – Social links and additional info.

The app is fully responsive, works in both light and dark modes, and features smooth scrolling between sections.
